Add the ability to use a custom working directory.

After switching custom icon, old icon still in use and unable to delete.

Is there any way in the settings to change where on the circle each icon goes? Also, I didn't see any way of changing the order of the icons without removing them.

Unchecking custom icon doesn't change the icon the first time around, but works if going to settings -> save again. Perhaps due to path still being kept the first time around?
